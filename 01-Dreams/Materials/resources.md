## Description\
\
The outcome of the survey of 981 respondents on phase state (PS): lucid dreaming (LD), sleep paralysis (SP), out-of-body experiences (OBE), and false awakening (FA). The survey took place in Moscow, Russia (March 16-17, 2019) Survey The study took place on March 16th and 17th, 2019 in the form of a live survey on the streets of Moscow, Russia. \
\
A group of nine assistants was instructed to ask passersby a list of specific questions regarding our study. Since this study was a voluntary, non-experimental survey, no ethical approval was needed. \
\
Questions and personal data \
The questionnaire contained seven questions: \
\
 1. sleep duration (SD), measured in average number of hours for all days per week.  \
 2. dream memory (DM/DRF) frequency, with the options of \'91never,\'92 \'91sometimes,\'92 \'91often,\'92 and \'91cannot answer.\'92  \
 3. LD frequency, with the options of \'91never,\'92 \'91once,\'92 \'91sometimes,\'92 \'91often,\'92 and \'91cannot answer.\'92  \
 4. FA frequency, with the same options that were given for the third question.  \
 5. SP frequency, with the same options that were given for the third question.  \
 6. OBE frequency, with the same options that were given for the third question.  \
 7.  overall awareness (AW) about practices like lucid dreaming, astral projecting, or OBE, with the options of \'91no,\'92  \'91yes,\'92 and \'91cannot answer.\'92\
\
Four more questions were asked to obtain respondents\'92 personal information (age, name, gender, and phone number). All the filled-out questionnaires were saved in their original physical form and in scanned copies.\
\
Statistical analysis \
To create PS data we united LD, OBE, FA, and SP data. If there were at least two \'91yes\'92 or \'91once\'92, it was counted as \'91sometimes\'92 for PS. If there were at least three answers \'91sometimes\'92, it was counted as \'91often\'92 for PS. If there were at least one \'91often\'92, it was counted as \'91often\'92 for PS. \
